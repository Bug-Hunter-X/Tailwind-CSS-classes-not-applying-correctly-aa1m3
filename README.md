# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied as expected.  The problem occurs in `MyComponent.jsx`, where Tailwind CSS classes seem to be ignored or rendered improperly.

## Bug

The component is intended to have a gray background, padding, specific text styles, etc., but these are missing.  This often stems from incorrect configuration, missing build steps, or errors in how Tailwind CSS is integrated into the project.

## Solution

The solution involves checking that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and included in your build process. This may involve verifying your `tailwind.config.js` file, ensuring that the correct `@tailwind` directives are present in your CSS file and building the CSS correctly in your build process.
